Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
This script already uses a vast amount of data but with some modification within the data this script can be used for any election.
First, we can include the demographical structure of each county where the elections are being help. this wil help us determine which county has what kind of demographic. Demography can be according to the populations political preference or race. If we have this data, it can be manipulated into different scenarios. For example: which race is dominant i a certain county and what political alliance they are inclined to.
Second, we can also use the data to pin point the amount of votes each candidates received for each county. for example: it will be helpful for the candidates to know in which county they are being favored by tons of votes. If we can include this in the script, the candidates will know where to focus their campaing on.
